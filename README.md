This is the learning about build game in C++ by using the SFML library

What I've learned about it so far:

**In using the SFML library:**
  1. Create a Game System Manager --> takes care how the system inside of the game works
  2. Create a Game Asset Manager --> to manage the asset of the game
  3. Create a Game class --> to manage the game mechanics, levels, players, etc.
  4. How to call the SFML library to use by MakeFile

**In using C++:**
  1. The difference between .h file and .hpp file
  2. How to create a class and include it to the other .cpp file
  3. How to create a abstract class in C++
